Notes:
Change price from JSON string to JSON int value? (fails in app atm as price = a swift Double type)

Mandatory fields right now:
Cart model fields: merchantEmail, products, cartProducts, cartTotal
Product model fields: name, price
all other fields are optional.

Should we add to or remove any of these mandatories?

Aside:
Should we sanitize inputs to JSON on front end before generating qr? (+ will fail if improper in app)

V2 possibilities:
Allow merchants to add image(s) per product.
Allow merchants to add logo.
